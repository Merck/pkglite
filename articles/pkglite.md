# Compact Package Representations

## Introduction

`pkglite` offers a solution for converting R package source code to a
compact, text-based representation and restore the source package
structure from the representation. There are three specific aims:

1.  To provide a **tool** for packing and restoring R packages as plain
    text assets that are easy to store, transfer, and review.
2.  To provide a **grammar** for specifying the file packing scope that
    is functional, precise, and extendable.
3.  To provide a **standard** for exchanging the packed asset that is
    unambiguous, human-friendly, and machine-readable.

To achieve these goals, we developed a pipe-friendly workflow, the
concept of file specifications and file collections, and a format
specification for the output file `pkglite.txt`. These designs allow us
to leave a clear and skimmable trace in the code when generating such
compact representations, thus improves reproducibility.

## Example workflow

To demonstrate the basic usage of pkglite, we will show how to pack and
unpack one or multiple R packages.

``` r
library("pkglite")
```

### Pack one package

First, locate the input package directory and the output file:

``` r
pkg <- system.file("examples/pkg1", package = "pkglite")
txt <- tempfile(fileext = ".txt")
```

Use the following chain of calls to pack a default set of files in the R
package under directory `pkg` into the file `txt`:

``` r
pkg %>%
  collate(file_default()) %>%
  pack(output = txt, quiet = TRUE)
```

The [`collate()`](https://merck.github.io/pkglite/reference/collate.md)
function evaluates one or more **file specifications** to generate a
**file collection**. They fully determine the scope of the files to pack
here. For details, check
[`vignette("filespec", package = "pkglite")`](https://merck.github.io/pkglite/articles/filespec.md).

Check the first lines of the output file:

``` r
txt %>%
  readLines() %>%
  head(11) %>%
  cat(sep = "\n")
#> # Generated by pkglite: do not edit by hand
#> # Use pkglite::unpack() to restore the packages
#> 
#> Package: pkg1
#> File: DESCRIPTION
#> Format: text
#> Content:
#>   Package: pkg1
#>   Type: Package
#>   Title: Example Package One
#>   Version: 0.1.0
```

Check the number of lines the output file:

``` r
txt %>%
  readLines() %>%
  length()
#> [1] 1081
```

### Unpack one package

To unpack (restore) the file structures from the text file, use
[`unpack()`](https://merck.github.io/pkglite/reference/unpack.md):

``` r
out <- file.path(tempdir(), "onepkg")
txt %>% unpack(output = out, quiet = TRUE)
```

This will create a directory named after the R package under the output
directory:

``` r
out %>%
  file.path("pkg1") %>%
  list.files()
#> [1] "data"        "DESCRIPTION" "man"         "NAMESPACE"   "NEWS.md"    
#> [6] "R"           "README.md"   "vignettes"
```

To install the packages after unpacking them, use
`unpack(..., install = TRUE)`.

### Pack multiple packages

[`pack()`](https://merck.github.io/pkglite/reference/pack.md) accepts
one or more input directories. Therefore, one can pack multiple R
packages (file collections) into one file at once:

``` r
pkg1 <- system.file("examples/pkg1", package = "pkglite")
pkg2 <- system.file("examples/pkg2", package = "pkglite")

fc1 <- pkg1 %>% collate(file_default())
fc2 <- pkg2 %>% collate(file_default())

pack(fc1, fc2, output = txt, quiet = TRUE)
```

Since the two example packages have almost identical content, the number
of lines in the text file is doubled here (three header lines excluded):

``` r
txt %>%
  readLines() %>%
  length()
#> [1] 2159
```

### Unpack multiple packages

Use the same call to unpack (and install) multiple R packages from the
text file:

``` r
out <- file.path(tempdir(), "twopkgs")
txt %>% unpack(output = out, quiet = TRUE)
```

``` r
out %>%
  file.path("pkg1") %>%
  list.files()
#> [1] "data"        "DESCRIPTION" "man"         "NAMESPACE"   "NEWS.md"    
#> [6] "R"           "README.md"   "vignettes"
out %>%
  file.path("pkg2") %>%
  list.files()
#> [1] "data"        "DESCRIPTION" "man"         "NAMESPACE"   "NEWS.md"    
#> [6] "R"           "README.md"   "vignettes"
```

The file format specification for `pkglite.txt` is described in
[`vignette("format", package = "pkglite")`](https://merck.github.io/pkglite/articles/format.md).

## Helper functions

Verify if the text file contains only ASCII characters:

``` r
txt %>% verify_ascii()
#> [1] TRUE
```

Remove lines of file content from the text file:

``` r
txt %>% remove_content(c("## New Features", "## Improvements"), quiet = TRUE)
```

``` r
txt %>%
  readLines() %>%
  length()
#> [1] 2157
```
